## Bar theme for zsh

Features:

* It looks not like Christmas tree. Most of [OMZ themes](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes) look like üéÑ üíà Christmas garland and frustrate attention. But terminal is most for write commands and get output, not for color juggling üñ• 

* It has three attention aspects by priority: first - command and path, second - output, third - pills/sections üëì 

* It has a bar along all space and it is a great separator ‚¨õÔ∏è 

* The command beginning has fixed position and command has color with intensity. It's great for reading and typing üíö 

* The pills/sections placed to right but not in RPROMPT and it allows you to secure copy the command and output without environmental disclosure üîí 

* The pills/sections can have additional background or color accent if you need üíä

## [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
Instead of using this basic zsh-theme you can try powerful [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k):
* OR with the proof of concept config [p10k-bar.zsh](https://gist.github.com/romkatv/7f48d0deae7a3449f34a4870feaba0f5)
* OR with more carefully `.zshrc` settings (recommend):
