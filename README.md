## Bar theme for zsh

Features:

* It looks not like Christmas tree. Most of OMZ themes look like 🎄 💈 Christmas garland and frustrate attention. But terminal is most for write commands and get output, not for color juggling 🖥 

* It has three attention aspects by priority: first - command and path, second - output, third - pills/sections 👓 

* It has a bar along all space and it is a great separator ⬛️ 

* The command beginning has fixed position and command has color with intensity. It's great for reading and typing 💚 

* The pills/sections placed to right but not in RPROMPT and it allows you to secure copy the command and output without environmental disclosure 🔒
